# Amazon_Vine_Analysis and Big Data

## Overview of Project
A start company, Bigmarket, hired you as a data expert to help them get the most from their marketing campaign. The first client you are working with is Sellby and they want to list many products on a sales website. They are interested in gathering reviews of their products and comparing them against that of other products and giving free product out to survey participants. But before they do this, Sellby wants a risk/benefit analysis to see if it is worth their money. You will need to convert the words in the reviews to numbers to be able to use big data for this task.
